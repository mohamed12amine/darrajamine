                    <h4>Sport:</h4>
                    <p>In general I am in love with Sports and it is one of my best and favourite hobbies since I was child, my main Sport that I am still practicing since 2014 is a Martial Art named Haidong Gumdo founded in south of Korea. As I said I started this nobel Martial Art in 2014 until now and I am black belted. <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haidong_gumdo" target="_blank">Click here</a> for more information about Haidong Gumdo, Also <a href="http://www.baekhorabat-hdgd.com/" target="_blank">click here</a> to visit my Dojang (school) website. Before 2014 I practiced different sports like Soccer, and two other Martial Arts which are Volam or Vietmanese Martial Art, this one was perfect but seems to be less famous than other arts, and <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hapkido" target="_blank">Hapkido</a>, a korean Martial Art same as Haidong Gumdo. Also I am interested in Basketball and I practice it a lot with my friends. for see my video.</p>

                    <h4>Programming:</h4>
                    <p>Actually Programming is a part of my Specialized technician diploma studies but it became one of my hobbies I loved it despite I am still a beginner and I look forward to emprove my skills and learn more programming languages, I already started learning C language and JAVA8 at school and during my free time I practice Web programming (HTML5, CSS, JavaScript). It is not only adding new skills but it is also a way to take a fresh look at life and boosts brain. It is true that programming skills do not come easy, but they will if I keep up the practice.</p>

                    <h4>Drawing:</h4>
                    <p>Drawing is a great hobby for those who know what patience is. This means that more you are patient more you draw masterpieces. Though I am a beginner, but believe me if you can handle fishing the whole day and getting back home bare handed, you can handle drawing. I started drawing in 2015, I have to admit that I was an absolute beginner. I tought that I could never make it. I Started learning and practicing, I was trying my best to learn as much as I can. As the days go by I improved my skills and started having self confidence and believing in myself. My experience with drawing taught me to never give up and to always fight and struggle to achieve your goals and dreams.</p>
